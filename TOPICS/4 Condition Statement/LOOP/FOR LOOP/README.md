# **FOR LOOP**
> A `for loop` is used when you know in advance how many times you want to run a block of code.

##  **Syntax of a for loop**
```
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```

## **✨ Explanation:** 
* **Initialization** – runs once at the beginning (e.g., `int i = 0`)
* **Condition** – loop runs as long as this is true (e.g., `i < 5`)
* **Update** – changes the loop variable each time (e.g., `i++`)
